This is code that I wrote for a project I did with another student titled "Measuring Cardiac Electrical Activity With an FRDM-K64F microcontroller and an Analog Devices AD8232 Integrated Signal Conditioning Block" for an embedded systems class.

In order for this code to compile, you need some device specific libraries that have macro definitions for registers, devices, etc.
